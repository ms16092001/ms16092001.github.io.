		<h4>What is it?</h4>
		<p>

		     Feosol is an iron supplement used by people concerned about the amount of iron in their blood. Iron is vital to the transport of oxygen in the bloodstream to the cells in the body. Feosol is sometimes prescribed to patients with iron-deficiency anemia, poor nutrition, or pregnancy â€“ any condition involving a shortage of iron in the red blood cells.

	<h2>Anemia caused by destruction of red blood cells</h2>

		<h4>What is it?</h4>
		<p><span>
			When red blood cells are fragile and can’t handle the stress of traveling through your body, they may burst, causing what’s called hemolytic anemia. You might have this condition at birth, or it could come later.</span>
		</p>

		<h4>The causes of hemolytic anemia are unclear, but they can include:</h4>
		<p><span>

			1. An attack by your immune system, as with lupus. This can happen to anyone, even a baby still in the womb or a newborn. That’s called hemolytic disease of the newborn.<br/>
			2. Conditions that can be passed down through your genes, such as sickle cell anemia, thalassemia, and thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura (TTP)<br/>
			3. Enlarged spleen. This can, in rare cases, trap red blood cells and destroy them too early.<br/>
			4.Something that puts strain on your body, such as infections, drugs, snake or spider venom, or certain foods<br/>
			5. Toxins from advanced liver or kidney disease<br/>
			6. Vascular grafts, prosthetic heart valves, tumors, severe burns, being around certain chemicals, severe hypertension, and clotting disorders<br/>
		
		</p>

		<h4>Cure</h4>

			If you have this type of anemia ie(hemolytic anemia) , you might need medication that will hold back your immune system. Your primary care doctor may refer you to a doctor who specializes in vascular problems.

	<h2>PROCRIT</h2>
		<h4>What is it?</h4>
		<p>
		<span>
			  Procrit is an injectable brand-name prescription drug that helps the body make red blood cells. The active ingredient is a protein, epoetin alfa, which is manufactured from living cells. Procrit treats anemia caused by either chronic kidney disease (CKD), chemotherapy, or AIDS/HIV treatment with the prescription drug, zidovudine.

              Procrit is injected either by a healthcare provider or self-injected by the patient.

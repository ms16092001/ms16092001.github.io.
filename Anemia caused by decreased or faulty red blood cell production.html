	<h2>Anemia caused by decreased or faulty red blood cell production</h2>
		<h4>What is it?</h4>
		<p>
		<span>
			With this type of anemia, your body may not create enough blood cells, or they may not work the way they should. This can happen because there’s something wrong with your red blood cells or because you don’t have enough minerals and vitamins for your red blood cells to form normally.

		</p>

		<h4>Conditions associated with these causes of anemia include:</h4>
		<p>
		<span>	
		<br/>

		1. Bone marrow and stem cell problems.<br/>
		2. Iron-deficiency anemia.<br/>
		3. Sickle cell anemia.<br/>
		4. Vitamin-deficiency anemia, specifically b12 or folate.<br/><br>
		Bone marrow and stem cell problems may keep your body from producing enough red blood cells. Some of the stem cells in the marrow that’s in the center of your bones will develop into red blood cells. If there aren’t enough stem cells, if they don’t work right, or if they’re replaced by other cells such as cancer cells, you might get anemia.<br><br>
		Iron-deficiency anemia happens because you don’t have enough of the mineral iron in your body. Your bone marrow needs iron to make hemoglobin, the part of the red blood cell that takes oxygen to your organs. <br><br>
		Sickle cell anemia is a disorder that, in the U.S., affects mainly African Americans and Hispanic Americans. Your red blood cells, which are usually round, become crescent-shaped because of a problem in your genes. Anemia results when the red blood cells break down quickly, so oxygen doesn’t get to your organs. The crescent-shaped red blood cells can also get stuck in tiny blood vessels and cause pain.<br><br>
		Vitamin-deficiency anemia can happen when you aren’t getting enough vitamin B12 and folate. You need these two vitamins to make red blood cells. This kind of anemia can be caused by:<br>Dietary deficiency: If you eat little or no meat, you might not get enough vitamin B12. If you overcook vegetables or don’t eat enough of them, you might not get enough folate.<br>Megaloblastic anemia: When you don’t get enough vitamin B12, folate, or both<br>Pernicious anemia: When your body doesn’t absorb enough vitamin B12<br>

		<h4>Cure</h4>
		<p><span>
			1)If you have aplastic anemia, you might need medication, blood transfusions (in which you get blood from another person), or a bone marrow transplant (in which you get a donor’s stem cells).<br>
			2)If you have iron-deficiency anemia, you’ll probably need to take iron supplements and change your diet.<br>
			3)Sickle cell anemia treatment includes painkillers, folic acid supplements, intermittent antibiotics or oxygen therapy. A drug. called hydroxyurea (Droxia, Hydrea, Siklos) is often prescribed to decrease sickle cell pain crises (complicated mechanism). The medication called voxelator (Oxbryta) whichcan help your red blood cells keep their proper shape. Crizanlizumab-tmca (Adakveo) can keep the blood cells from sticking together and blocking vessels. L-glutamine oral powder (Endari) can cut down on your trips to the hospital for pain and also guard against a condition called acute chest syndrome. <br>
			4)If you have a vitamin B12 or folate deficiency, you will be prescribed supplements.<br>

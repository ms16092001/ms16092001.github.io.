    				<h3 style="text-decoration: underline;">How anemia occurs and some suggestions</h3>
    				<p align="justify"> 
    					 Anemia occurs when a person has too few red blood cells or insufficient amounts of a vital blood protein called hemoglobin. This means your blood may not be carrying enough oxygen to all parts of your body.Some types of anemia are preventable, the National Women's Health Information Center says. It offers these suggestions:
    					 1) Eat plenty of iron-rich foods, such as tofu, green and leafy vegetables, lean red meat, lentils, beans and iron-fortified cereals and breads.
                         2) Eat and drink vitamin C-rich foods and drinks.
                         3) Avoid drinking tea or coffee with your meals, as they can affect iron absorption.
                         Get enough vitamin B12 and folic acid in your diet.

    				<h3 style="text-decoration: underline;">Anemia in children</h3>
    				<p align="justify">
    					Anemia is a condition in which the amount of red blood cells in the body is decreased below normal for your child's age. It can make your child appear pale in color and feel cranky, tired, or weak. Though these symptoms may worry you, the most common causes of anemia―such as iron deficiency―are generally easy to treat, especially when it is detected early. .<br/>
    					Iron-deficiency anemia and other nutritional anemias can be prevented by ensuring that your child eats a well-balanced diet. Talk with your doctor about any specific dietary restrictions in your household as your child may require a nutritional supplementation to prevent anemia. .<br/> If your child starts to show any signs or symptoms of anemia, be sure to tell your pediatrician. Also, find out if anyone in your family has a history of anemia or problems with easy bleeding. With proper treatment, your child's anemia should improve quickly.

    				<p align="justify">
    					There are many types of anemia. All have different causes and treatments. Some forms like the mild anemia that happens during pregnancy aren’t a major concern. But some types of anemia may reflect a serious underlying medical condition
    				     There are more than 400 types of anemia, and they’re divided into three groups:
                         1)Anemia caused by blood loss<br>

    				<p align="justify">
    					The greatest disease in the World today is not TB or leprosy; it is being unwanted, unloved, and uncared for. We can cure physical diseases with medicine, but the only cure for loneliness, despair, and hopelessness is love. There are many in the world who are dying for a piece of bread but there are many more dying for a little love. <br/>
